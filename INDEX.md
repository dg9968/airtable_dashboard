## 📋 Quick Reference

### Project Structure
```
packages/
├── client/    # Next.js frontend (:3000)
└── server/    # Bun + Hono API (:3001)
```

### Common Commands
```bash
bun run dev:all       # Run both client and server
bun run dev:client    # Client only
bun run dev:server    # Server only
bun run build         # Build both
```

### Key Files Created
- `packages/client/lib/api.ts` - API utilities for calling server
- `packages/client/app/api/auth/*` - NextAuth routes
- `packages/server/src/index.ts` - Hono server entry point
- Environment templates in both packages

## 🎯 Your Journey

### ✅ Phase 1: Setup (Complete)
- Monorepo structure created
- Dependencies split and installed
- Server tested and working
- Documentation created

### 🔄 Phase 2: API Migration (Current)
**What you need to do:**
1. Convert API routes from Next.js to Hono format
2. Update client code to use server APIs
3. Test each endpoint

**Start here:** [NEXT_STEPS.md](./NEXT_STEPS.md)

### ⏳ Phase 3: Testing (Next)
- Test all features end-to-end
- Verify authentication works
- Check all integrations (Airtable, S3, Google Drive)

### 🚀 Phase 4: Production (Future)
- Deploy to Render.com
- Configure production environment
- Monitor and optimize

## 🔍 Finding What You Need

### "How do I run this?"
→ [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md) - Section "Getting Started"

### "What needs to be done?"
→ [NEXT_STEPS.md](./NEXT_STEPS.md) - Section "Step-by-Step"

### "How do I convert an API route?"
→ [NEXT_STEPS.md](./NEXT_STEPS.md) - Section "Step 2: Convert One API Route"
→ [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) - Detailed examples

### "Why is X returning 404?"
→ [NEXT_STEPS.md](./NEXT_STEPS.md) - Section "Current Situation"
→ [STATUS.md](./STATUS.md) - Section "What Needs to Be Done"

### "How does the architecture work?"
→ [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) - Full diagrams and explanations

### "What commands are available?"
→ [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md) - Section "Available Commands"
→ [README.md](./README.md) - Section "Available Scripts"

### "How do I deploy this?"
→ [README.md](./README.md) - Section "Deployment"

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
See [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md) - Section "Common Issues"

### Cannot Find Module
```bash
bun install
```

### API Returning 404
This is expected! Routes need to be migrated to Hono.
See [NEXT_STEPS.md](./NEXT_STEPS.md)

### Environment Variables Not Working
- Client: Must start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for browser
- Server: All vars work
- Restart dev servers after changes

## 📞 Need Help?

1. Check the relevant documentation above
2. Look at existing code patterns in `packages/server/src/`
3. Review the [NEXT_STEPS.md](./NEXT_STEPS.md) examples

## 🎉 Ready to Start?

### Option 1: Just Run It
```bash
bun install
bun run dev:all
```

### Option 2: Understand First
1. Read [STATUS.md](./STATUS.md) (5 min)
2. Read [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md) (5 min)
3. Start with [NEXT_STEPS.md](./NEXT_STEPS.md) (follow along)

### Option 3: Deep Dive
1. Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) (10 min)
2. Read [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) (15 min)
3. Study code structure
4. Start migrating APIs

**Recommended Path:** Option 2 (Understand First)

**First Document:** [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md) → Then [NEXT_STEPS.md](./NEXT_STEPS.md)

Good luck! 🚀
