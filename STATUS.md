# Project Status

## ✅ Completed: Monorepo Refactoring

**Date:** October 12, 2025

Your Airtable Dashboard has been successfully refactored into a Bun monorepo!

### 🎯 What Works Now

✅ **Monorepo Structure**
- Separate `packages/client` and `packages/server`
- Bun workspaces configured
- Independent dependency management

✅ **Server (Hono + Bun)**
- Running on http://localhost:3001
- Health check endpoint working: `/health`
- CORS configured for client communication
- Hot reload enabled for fast development

✅ **Client (Next.js 15)**
- Ready to run on http://localhost:3000
- All UI components, hooks, and pages in place
- NextAuth routes properly configured
- API utility functions created

✅ **Documentation**
- Complete setup guides created
- Migration examples provided
- Step-by-step instructions available

### 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not done)
bun install

# Run both client and server
bun run dev:all

# Or run separately:
bun run dev:client   # Client on :3000
bun run dev:server   # Server on :3001
```

### ⚠️ What Needs to Be Done Next

**Priority 1: Migrate API Routes**

The API routes in `packages/server/src/api/` still use Next.js format. They need to be converted to Hono format and registered in the server.

**Status:** Routes are in place but not wired up to Hono yet.

**Action Required:**
1. Read [NEXT_STEPS.md](./NEXT_STEPS.md) for detailed instructions
2. Start with converting one route (e.g., `/api/airtable`)
3. Test it works
4. Continue with other routes

**Priority 2: Update Client API Calls**

Some client pages may still call `/api/...` directly instead of using the server URL.

**Status:** API utility created at `packages/client/lib/api.ts`

**Action Required:**
1. Replace direct `fetch('/api/...')` calls with `apiGet()`, `apiPost()`, etc.
2. Import from `@/lib/api`

Example:
```typescript
// Before
const response = await fetch('/api/airtable');

// After
import { apiGet } from '@/lib/api';
const data = await apiGet('/api/airtable');
```

### 🎯 Current Architecture

**Authentication Flow:**
```
User → Next.js Client (:3000) → NextAuth API Routes (local)
                               → Session Management
```

**Data Flow:**
```
User → Next.js Client (:3000) → Hono Server (:3001) → Airtable/AWS/Google
     ← JSON Response         ← JSON Response        ← Data
```

### 📊 Migration Progress

- [x] Create monorepo structure
- [x] Split dependencies
- [x] Move files to packages
- [x] Configure TypeScript
- [x] Create Hono server
- [x] Set up environment templates
- [x] Create documentation
- [x] Test server startup
- [x] Move auth routes to client
- [x] Create API utilities
- [ ] Convert API routes to Hono (0 of ~10 routes)
- [ ] Update client API calls
- [ ] Test full authentication flow
- [ ] Test all features end-to-end

### 🔧 Development Workflow

**Typical Development Session:**

1. Start both services:
   ```bash
   bun run dev:all
   ```

2. Client changes:
   - Edit files in `packages/client/`
   - Hot reload works automatically
   - View at http://localhost:3000

3. Server changes:
   - Edit files in `packages/server/src/`
   - Hot reload works automatically
   - Test at http://localhost:3001

4. Test integration:
   - Make changes
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Check server terminal for API logs

### 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** "Port already in use"
**Solution:** Kill existing bun processes via Task Manager (Windows) or `pkill bun` (Mac/Linux)

**Issue:** "Cannot find module"
**Solution:** Run `bun install` in root directory

**Issue:** "Auth endpoints returning 404"
**Solution:** This is expected! Auth routes are now in `packages/client/app/api/auth/` and work through Next.js

**Issue:** "Other API endpoints returning 404"
**Solution:** These need to be migrated to Hono. See [NEXT_STEPS.md](./NEXT_STEPS.md)

### ✨ Benefits of New Architecture

1. **Clear Separation:** Frontend and backend are completely independent
2. **Better Performance:** Bun is significantly faster than Node.js
3. **Easier Deployment:** Can deploy client and server separately
4. **Better DX:** Hot reload on both client and server
5. **Type Safety:** Shared types can be created in a common package
6. **Scalability:** Can scale frontend and backend independently

### 🎉 Next Actions

1. **Immediate:** Read [NEXT_STEPS.md](./NEXT_STEPS.md)
2. **Today:** Set up environment variables and test `bun run dev:all`
3. **This Week:** Convert 2-3 API routes to Hono
4. **Next Week:** Complete API migration and test all features
