# Authentication Fix - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem
Users existed in Airtable but couldn't log in. Error message:
```
AirtableError { error: 'NOT_FOUND', statusCode: 404 }
Authentication error: Invalid credentials
```

## Root Cause
**Missing Airtable credentials in client environment file.**

The client's `.env.local` file (`packages/client/.env.local`) was missing:
- `AIRTABLE_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID`
- `AIRTABLE_USERS_TABLE`

NextAuth runs in the Next.js client and needs these variables to query the Airtable Users table for authentication.

## Solution Applied ✅

Updated `packages/client/.env.local` with the Airtable credentials:

```env
# Airtable Configuration (needed for NextAuth)
AIRTABLE_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=pat9FQ5kF5RImD5xY...
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=app3Gj45Ql7EwjLIg
AIRTABLE_USERS_TABLE=Users
```

## Verification

Created debug script to verify auth setup:
```bash
bun run scripts/debug-auth.ts <email>
```

**Test Results:**
```
✅ Connection successful!
✅ User found!
✅ Has PasswordHash: Yes ✓
✅ User should be able to log in!
```

## How to Test Login

1. **Restart the client** (to load new env variables):
   ```bash
   # Stop current client (Ctrl+C)
   bun run dev:client
   ```

2. **Navigate to login page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/auth/signin
   ```

3. **Login with existing user:**
   - Email: `daniel@vault1040.com`
   - Password: (your actual password)

4. **Should succeed!** ✅

## Available Users

Run to see all users:
```bash
bun run scripts/manage-users.ts list
```

**Current users in database:**
1. Daniel Galindo - daniel@vault1040.com (admin)
2. Noemi Aguirre - noemi@vault1040.com (user)
3. Scarlett Torres - scarlett@vault1040.com (admin)
4. Evelina Galindo - evelina@vault1040.com (admin)
5. Javier Lopez - (check email with list command)
6. (1 more user)

## Debug Tools Created

### 1. Authentication Debug Script
**File:** `scripts/debug-auth.ts`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Check if user can log in
bun run scripts/debug-auth.ts <email>

# Example
bun run scripts/debug-auth.ts daniel@vault1040.com
```

**What it checks:**
- ✅ Environment variables are set
- ✅ Airtable connection works
- ✅ User exists in database
- ✅ User has password hash
- ✅ Shows exact query being used

### 2. User Management Script
**File:** `scripts/manage-users.ts`

**Usage:**
```bash
# List all users
bun run scripts/manage-users.ts list

# Find specific user
bun run scripts/manage-users.ts find <email>

# Create new user
bun run scripts/manage-users.ts create

# Delete user
bun run scripts/manage-users.ts delete <email>
```

## Important Notes

### Environment Files Locations

**Client** needs Airtable credentials for NextAuth:
- File: `packages/client/.env.local`
- Needs: `AIRTABLE_*` variables

**Server** needs Airtable credentials for API operations:
- File: `packages/server/.env`
- Needs: `AIRTABLE_*` variables

**Both need the same Airtable credentials!**

### Why Client Needs Airtable Access

NextAuth runs in the Next.js server-side context (client package), not the Hono API server. The auth routes (`/api/auth/*`) are Next.js API routes that need to query Airtable to authenticate users.

This is why we kept `/api/auth/*` in the client package instead of migrating to Hono.

## Troubleshooting

### Still getting 404 errors?

1. **Check environment is loaded:**
   ```bash
   bun run scripts/debug-auth.ts <your-email>
   ```

2. **Restart the client:**
   ```bash
   # Environment changes require restart
   bun run dev:client
   ```

3. **Verify user exists:**
   ```bash
   bun run scripts/manage-users.ts find <your-email>
   ```

### User has no password?

If debug script shows "Has PasswordHash: No ✗":

```bash
# Recreate the user
bun run scripts/manage-users.ts delete <email>
bun run scripts/manage-users.ts create <email> "Name" "password" admin
```

### Wrong table name?

Check your Airtable:
1. Go to https://airtable.com
2. Open your base
3. Verify table is named exactly "Users" (case-sensitive)
4. Or update `AIRTABLE_USERS_TABLE` in `.env.local`
